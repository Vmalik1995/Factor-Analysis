## I. Macroeconomic Factors

### A. Interest Rates
Interest rates have a significant impact on residential home prices. If interest rates are high, fewer people will be able to afford to buy homes, and this will cause demand to decrease. If interest rates are low, more people will be able to afford homes, which will increase demand and drive up prices. Over the next 10 years, interest rates are likely to rise, which could result in a slowdown in the housing market and a decrease in home prices.

### B. Inflation
Inflation can also have an impact on home prices. If inflation is high, the cost of building materials and labor will increase, which will drive up the cost of building new homes. This will increase the cost of housing overall, and lead to an increase in home prices. Over the next 10 years, inflation is expected to rise gradually, which could contribute to an increase in home prices.

### C. GDP Growth
GDP growth can impact the housing market in several ways. When the economy is growing, more people have jobs, which means more people have the means to buy homes. Additionally, when GDP is growing, it can lead to an increase in consumer confidence, which can lead to more people being willing to make big purchases like buying a home. Over the next 10 years, GDP growth is expected to be moderate, which could lead to a steady increase in home prices.

### D. Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate can have a significant impact on home prices. When the unemployment rate is high, fewer people have the means to buy homes, which can lead to a decrease in demand and a decrease in home prices. Conversely, when the unemployment rate is low, more people have jobs and more people have the means to buy homes, which can lead to an increase in demand and an increase in home prices. Over the next 10 years, the unemployment rate is expected to gradually decline, which could contribute to an increase in home prices.

## II. Demographic Factors

### A. Population Growth
Population growth can impact home prices by increasing demand for housing. As the population grows, more people will need homes to live in, which can lead to an increase in demand and an increase in home prices. Over the next 10 years, population growth is expected to be moderate, which could contribute to a steady increase in home prices.

### B. Aging Population
The aging of the population can also impact home prices. As the baby boomer generation continues to age, more people will be looking to downsize or move into assisted living facilities. This could lead to an increase in the supply of homes on the market, which could lead to a decrease in home prices. Over the next 10 years, the baby boomer generation is expected to continue to age, which could contribute to a decrease in home prices.

### C. Migration Patterns
Migration patterns can impact home prices by changing the demand for housing in different areas. For example, if there is an influx of people moving to a certain area, the demand for housing in that area will increase

## III. Market Factors

### A.Supply and demand
The basic economic principle of supply and demand is a major factor that influences home prices. When the supply of homes is low, and demand is high, prices tend to rise. When supply is high, and demand is low, prices tend to fall.

### B.Housing market cycles
The housing market is cyclical, with periods of boom and bust. Factors such as supply and demand, interest rates, and economic growth can all influence where the market is in its cycle, which can affect home prices.

### C.Housing inventory
The amount of homes available for sale can influence prices. If inventory is low, prices may increase as buyers compete for limited options. Conversely, if inventory is high, prices may decrease as sellers compete to attract buyers.



## IV.  Location-Specific Factors

### A.Local Economy 
Local economy plays a vital role when it comes to housing market investors and projects. A good local economy shows a good purchasing power and a good GDP in that area. Over the next 10 years the gdp will be steady in the US, so the house prices will be steady although this leads to another problem of housing projects and expansion around the cities.


### B.School Districts
The school districts will grow as the education and the number of schools present near will attract the demand for the properties near by as it will be easy to commute to the schools and colleges and with the rapid pace of the educational advancement and population the house prices in some certain districts can definitely go up due to this factor.

### C.Crime Rates
The crime rate affects the housing prices directly , as the demand will be very low in a crime affected area compared to that which has very low crime reporting. This directly leads to the demand and supply point, which says that higher demand higher price, lower demand lower price but is vice a versa when said in terms of supply.

# Summary

The Economic factors actually are the most potent ones which drives the housing prices directly.
Mortgage rate is another factor as Regulations on mortgage lending, such as credit requirements, down payment minimums, and loan limits, can all affect the demand for homes and impact home prices.
As the economy is predicted to be steady over the next 10 years the housing prices will not change so much.
The decisive factor here will be the local amenities, local economy and demographic dividend, which will drive this scenario towards the Demand and Supply cycle.
